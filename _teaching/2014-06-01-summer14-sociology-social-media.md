SOC 167 is an elective undergraduate course in UC-Berkeley&apos;s Sociology Department, providing a wide overview to how classic concepts in the social sciences play out in social media and virtual communities. I was the instructor of record, responsible for designing the course syllabus, designing all assignments and exams, giving all lectures, and supervising one teaching assistant who helped with grading.
